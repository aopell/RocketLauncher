Does the number of programs pinned to your taskbar seem to keep growing? Do you think you have too many programs pinned, but you are not sure which to remove? Maybe you have some programs you want to be able to open quickly, but they do not necessarily need to be on your taskbar? In any case, RocketLauncher keeps 7 programs in the place of one.

Just click Rocket Launcher > Add Program. It is that simple.
